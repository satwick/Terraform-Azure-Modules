Error: Provider configuration not present

To work with module.support_vm_windows.azurerm_windows_virtual_machine.vm
(orphan) its original provider configuration at
module.support_vm_windows.provider["registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/azurerm"]
is required, but it has been removed. This occurs when a provider
configuration is removed while objects created by that provider still exist
in the state. Re-add the provider configuration to destroy
module.support_vm_windows.azurerm_windows_virtual_machine.vm (orphan), after
which you can remove the provider configuration again.
